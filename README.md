Analysis
  
  Created bash script "data_inspection"
    Will add code snipet later, currently can't install Markdown because IT won't grant me admin privileges on my work computer
    
    In the terminal, executing "bash data_inspection 'filename'" will run the script on the given file
    Prints file size, total lines, total characters and character content, and number of columns in first line
